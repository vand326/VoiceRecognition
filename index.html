    <p align = "left">The first speech recognition systems were focused on numbers, not words. In 1952, Bell Laboratories designed the “Audrey” system which could recognize a single voice speaking digits aloud. Ten years later, IBM introduced “Shoebox” which understood and responded to 16 words in English.

    Across the globe other nations developed hardware that could recognize sound and speech. And by the end of the ‘60s, the technology could support words with four vowels and nine consonants.</p>

    <p align = "left">Speech recognition made several meaningful advancements in this decade. This was mostly due to the US Department of Defense and DARPA. The Speech Understanding Research (SUR) program they ran was one of the largest of its kind in the history of speech recognition. Carnegie Mellon’s “Harpy’ speech system came from this program and was capable of understanding over 1,000 words which is about the same as a three-year-old’s vocabulary.

    Also significant in the ‘70s was Bell Laboratories’ introduction of a system that could interpret multiple voices.</p>
